# Roboto Slab Font Project
by Christian Robertson

Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,
Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural
width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in
humanist and serif types.

This is the Roboto Slab family, which can be used alongside the normal
[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) family and the
[Roboto Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed) family.

This project is a fork from the old Google font repository.
